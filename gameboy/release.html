      The Nintendo Game Boy was released in Japan on April 21, 1989, and later in North America on July 31, 1989. Its European release followed in September 1990. The launch of the Game Boy was accompanied by the game "Tetris," which quickly became a massive hit and significantly boosted the console's popularity.

      Upon release, the Game Boy was met with positive reviews for its portability, game library, and battery life. Critics praised its durability and the quality of games available at launch. The inclusion of "Tetris" as a pack-in game was a masterstroke, as it appealed to a wide audience and showcased the Game Boy's capabilities.

      The Game Boy was a commercial success, selling out its initial shipment in weeks. It became one of the best-selling game consoles of all time, with over 118 million units sold worldwide across its various iterations. Its success paved the way for future handheld consoles and cemented Nintendo's position as a leader in the gaming industry.
